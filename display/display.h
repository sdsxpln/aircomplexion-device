@rows       : rowsd available on the LCD
@cols       : these are the number of columns available on the LCD
@bits       :Bits is the number of bits wide on the interface (4 or 8).
In 8 bit mode, each command or character is sent to the LCD as a single byte (8 bits) of data.The byte travels in parallel
over 8 data wires,with each bit travelling through itâ€™s own wire.8 bit mode has twice the bandwidth as 4 bit mode,
which in theory translates to higher data transfer speed.The main downside to 8 bit mode is that it uses up a lot of GPIO pins

We would prefer this to happen in the 4 bit mode
@rs         :is the RS pin on the displayed
@e          :Is the strobe(E) pin on lcd displaty
