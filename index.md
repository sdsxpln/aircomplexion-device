<!-- Making the reader aware of the problem statement and the KPIs that need be monitored. -->
## Air monitoring , awareness of the masses :
****
Masses may not be aware of how bad the air quality really gets. Human senses can ofcourse indicate a problem with the air we breathe with symptoms but that is only when beyond the thresholds. We dont have any sense of the quantification of the air components ,only when we faint do we realise the CO / Co2 is byond any acceptable limits.

Our product here has a sense of whats the current measure of the Co2, CO, So2, No2 and being connected to the cloud / internet it can broadcast information to the general masses.

- It can in general keep the masses aware of the low quality of the atmosphere we live in
- It then becomes easy to drive environmental messages across all the sections of the society since we have our claims backed by solid historical data.

## Coincident spikes in Co2 and dependants :
****

Measuring Co2 over the time axis along with other parameters can reveal coincident changes in the graphs and hence the possibility of an underlying mathematical relation.
Our best chance is to observe the spykes  in the graphical at the excat same time in temperature and light to know if the gaseous content really changes with time.

Winter in the client's campus needs a close vigil of the movment of Co2 content in parts per million. With the rising density we would have a intuitive rise in the Co2 corresponding to the increased density of air. Client needs to track other gaseous content as well.

- Carbon monoxide
- Nitrous oxide 
- Sulphur di-oxide

## Monitoring Co2 and pinging values to the database :

<!-- this section  is way too technical to be put out here -->
## Reading MQ135 with your RPi3
****

This sensor is handy , gets you a electrical signal that can read at definite intervals and assess the value of Co2 in the atmosphere.

advantages :
- reliability
- simplicity
- low price
- low operating power
- good sentivity

challenges :
- preheating time - stable readings only after 24Hours of heating.
- sensitivity characters vary with temp and moisture.
